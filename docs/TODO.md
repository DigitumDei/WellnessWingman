# TODO

- [x] Fix the Android build issue where the `xml/file_paths` resource is not found.
- [x] Fully implement the "Take Photo" button functionality:
    - [x] Add the button to the main page UI.
    - [x] Implement the `Clicked` event handler to capture a photo using the device's camera.
    - [x] Ensure all necessary permissions are correctly configured for both Android and iOS to allow camera and storage access.
- [x] Save captured photos into persistent storage:
  - [x] Determine permanent storage location in `FileSystem.AppDataDirectory`.
  - [x] Generate a unique filename (e.g., using a GUID) for each photo.
  - [x] Implement logic to copy the photo from the temporary `MediaPicker` location to the permanent path.
  - [x] Create a `TrackedEntry` model in memory with the correct `BlobPath` and metadata.
- [x] Implement SQLite persistence layer:
  - [x] Add EF Core SQLite NuGet packages to the project.
  - [x] Define `WellnessWingmanDbContext` with `DbSet`s for `TrackedEntry`, `EntryAnalysis`, and `DailySummary`.
  - [x] Configure entity relationships and payload serialization in `OnModelCreating`.
  - [x] Implement the `ITrackedEntryRepository`, `IEntryAnalysisRepository`, and `IDailySummaryRepository` interfaces.
  - [x] Set up automatic database creation/migration on app startup.
  - [x] Register the `DbContext` and repositories for dependency injection.
- [x] Deliver LLM provider configuration UX and storage:
  - [x] Introduce an `AppSettings` aggregate + `IAppSettingsRepository` that persists encrypted credentials via `SecureStorage`, matching the Security guidelines in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
  - [x] Add a settings page/page model pairing for provider selection and API key capture, wiring it to validation commands and secure storage updates.
  - [x] Gate `AnalysisOrchestrator` execution until valid provider credentials exist, surfacing inline errors and retry affordances in the UI.
  - [x] Expose provider/model preferences through DI (e.g., `MauiProgram`) so other services can resolve the active configuration without reading secrets directly.
- [x] Define the LLM provider interface and deliver an initial OpenAI adapter:
  - [x] Formalise the `ILLmClient` abstraction referenced in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, exposing `InvokeAnalysisAsync(TrackedEntry entry, LlmRequestContext context)` and structured result/diagnostic types so orchestrators can persist `EntryAnalysis` rows without parsing raw strings.
  - [x] Capture provider metadata (`ProviderId`, `Model`, rate-limit policy) alongside responses, ensuring `EntryAnalysis` persistence remains aligned with the ERD (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).
  - [x] Implement an `OpenAiLlmClient` under `Utilities/Services/Llm/` that reads API keys from secure storage, maps internal requests to OpenAI REST calls, and normalises error handling into the interface contracts.
  - [x] Register the interface and OpenAI implementation via `MauiProgram.ConfigureServices` so `AnalysisOrchestrator` receives the correct instance through dependency injection.
  - [x] Add configuration scaffolding (DTO + repository or options) for selecting provider/model at runtime while keeping raw credentials encrypted per the Security & Configuration guidelines.
- [x] Persist LLM responses into the new analysis tables via the orchestration pipeline.
  - [x] Introduce an `AnalysisOrchestrator` that reads provider settings, selects a model, and invokes the configured `ILLmClient`.
  - [x] Trigger analysis after meal capture so captured images are uploaded to the provider and persisted through `IEntryAnalysisRepository`.
- [ ] Generate daily summaries from stored analyses and surface them in the UI.
  - [ ] Design `SummaryService` contract to aggregate `EntryAnalysis` records by day, reusing provider diagnostics when relevant.
  - [ ] Implement a persistence workflow (`IDailySummaryRepository`) to upsert summaries and associate them with analyses.
  - [ ] Bind summaries to a new UI surface (dashboard card or page) with refresh logic in the relevant `PageModel`.
